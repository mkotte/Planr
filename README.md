# Project Idea  
## Project Management System (ex: trello.com)
### Technology To Use
* Bulma -CSS-  (*New Technology / npm package*)
* MYSQl (Sequelize(ORM), + Professional Appearing Seed File's)
* Express (Handlebars.js)
* Node.js (dotenv, bcrypt)
* Heroku, for deployement
* Encryption/Authentication for access (google*?)

### Desired Functionality
* Collaborative use between different user's on project boards
* Drag and drop functionality with posts/tasks, changing board to board
* Multiple in depth options for post/task content (i.e. comment's, checklists, due dates, assigned users etc)
* Login required for collaboration and save, otherwise not neccessary
* Professional appearance 
* Responsive UI

### Next Level Extra's
* Notification's for new task assignment's, completions etc
* Notification option's (could use email or text notifications)
* Tutorial for first time users (think similar to GitHub) 
* Templates for project boards (seeded information)
* Light / Dark switch
* Logo / Branding designs

If group is on board, task's need to be discussed and assigned based on priority.
