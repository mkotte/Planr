* Professional appearance 
* Responsive UI 

### Achieved / Completed Functionality 
* Drag and drop functionality
* Deployement
* Server and API's working as expected 
* Ability to create new tasks and automatically save them
* Using Handlebars and frontend JavaScript to append database information onto the project and user pages

### Next Level Extra's (i.e Future Developement)

* Notification option's (could use email or text notifications)
* Tutorial for first time users (think similar to GitHub) 
* Templates for project boards (seeded information)
